ENPM673: Perception for Autonomous Robotics Home Work 1

#### Instructions to run the program for problem 2
file name : ENPM673 Problem 2.py
data sets needed are data_1.csv and data_2.csv

Recommended IDE: PyCharm
Version of python : Python 3

Running Instructions:
Make sure the data sets (csv files) are the same folder as the python program.

We imported 3 libraries
numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and random

Probability threshold considered as 80%
Distance threshold considered as 70

Results:
You will get two graphs first one is for least square method and second one for RANSAC method.

#### Instructions to run the program for problem 3
file name : ENPM673 Problem3.py

Recommended IDE: PyCharm
Version of python : Python 3

Running Instructions:
Make sure the data sets (csv files) are the same folder as the python program.

We imported 2 libraries
numpy, math

Just open the file run

Results:
The program will calculate SVD for the given matrix A
THE program will also calculate SVD using inbuilt function SVD, just to verify the answers
